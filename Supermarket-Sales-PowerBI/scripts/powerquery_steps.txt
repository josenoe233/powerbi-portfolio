POWER QUERY – DATA TRANSFORMATION STEPS

1. Imported CSV dataset (supermarket_sales)
2. Changed data types for all numeric and date fields
3. Standardized Date column to Date type
4. Created DimDate table:
   - Year
   - Month (number)
   - Month Name
   - Quarter
5. Removed duplicates in dimension tables:
   - DimProduct
   - DimCustomer
   - DimPayment
   - DimBranch
6. Kept FactSales with transactional grain
7. Validated no nulls affecting relationships
